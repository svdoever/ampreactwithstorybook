# ampreact with Storybook
âš¡âš› [AMP HTML][amp], [Next.js][next], [React][react], [`styled-components`][styled]
â€” Based on the most trendy website boilerplate possible - adopted from https://github.com/dfrankland/ampreact.

## About

The core of `ampreact` is built on [Next.js][next], used for all the routing and
serving of pages. For styling, [`styled-components`][styled] makes it easyâ€”with
just a small modification to the rendering of the `<style />` tags generated,
it works nicely with [AMP HTML][amp]. Finally, [`react-amphtml`][react-amphtml]
is used for rendering all of the [AMP HTML][amp] built-ins, extensions, and
the `<script />` tags needed to use them.

The pages generated should all be properly validated by [AMP HTML][amp] ðŸ’¯

## Usage

All the usage and benefits of [Next.js][next] are available to `ampreact`.
